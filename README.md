My First android App to read the selected text file using Android Speech API
Why read a book when you phone can read it for you. This is my second android application that lets you choose a text file and it will read it for you.
It uses android's text to speech converter. Making it work was a greater deal for me as a naive android developer.
Detailed documentation coming soon.
